## Introduction

Vert is a library that is designed for manage and build middle or large scale projects which are based on Vue. Vert has it own best practice and design pattern, and comes with several APIs to help you to do some 
software engineering stuff. Maybe you will think it is something like `Angular + Vue` if you have ever used both of them.

If you feel bad about it, please just stop - it is not the time to use Vert for your project.

## Documentation

Currently documentation files are stored in `docs/` folder and they are under heavy construction.

## Development

Please note that Vert is shipped with **source code** from `src/` folder, `package.json` in root folder is marked as **private**.
